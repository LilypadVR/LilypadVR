In this video, I'm gonna show you how to calibrate the sensors of the trackers included in your LilypadVR set. First I'm gonna go over how to do this with the Cattail, since if you have one, this is the first thing you're gonna want to do before you start putting these things on. After that, I'll show you how to do the same with the Lilypads, which hopefully you'll never need to do because Lilypads come with the sensors pre-calibrated out of the box. The only time you will need to do this with any of your Lilypads is if you've already been using them for a little bit and you start to experience a significant amount of drift. The same goes for the Cattails, of course, if they start drifting severely you'll want to do this sensor calibration again with them.

With all that aside, let's get started with the Cattails.
